**AI Product & Technology Executive | Enterprise AI Strategy | Intelligent Systems Architect**

I design and lead the development of intelligent systems that combine structured data architectures, algorithmic decision logic, and applied AI to solve real-world business and coordination challenges at scale.

With 20+ years in complex software systems and digital transformation, I focus on building production-grade AI-enabled platforms inside enterprise environments.
